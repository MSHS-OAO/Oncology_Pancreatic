```{r cars}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

data <- read_excel("All Patients Newly Diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer_2024-07-02.xlsx") %>% mutate(YEAR = format(`Visit 1 Diagnosis  Date`, "%Y"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
